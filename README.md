Some examples with CartoDB

## Named Map using HTTPS and an Auth Token
Directory: named-map-auth-tokens

This has a small HTTPS server in Python, and an example of using layer.setAuthToken() to display a secure CartoDB named map without an API key. You can also see the template that created this map, with auth_tokens in named_map_template.txt.
